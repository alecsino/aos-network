# A Network Module built for BarrelfishOS

This module implements the protocols from the frame layer to the transport layer, and provides a simple interface for applications to use.

The driver was mostly written for BarrelfishOS, during a course at ETH Zurich, but can easily adapted for other systems.

## Features

**Network driver** containing ARP, IPv4, ICMP and UDP

**Network client** for applications to use
